this project also teaches students how to visualize the data using matplotlib
This project reads in two different csv files containing weather data from two different locations and appends the high and low temperatures of both locations and the dates where the temperatures occured. The appended weather data is then presented in a graph that illustrates the change in temperatures of both locations over the course of the dates.
